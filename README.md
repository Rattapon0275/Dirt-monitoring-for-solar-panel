# Dirt monitoring for solar panel
Designed by Rattapon Wayamanon, Porramee Yensiri

## Introduction
Light intensity is one of the factors that affects the performance of photovoltaic cells to generate electrical energy. Higher light intensity can increase the current generated by the panels. Dirtiness on the solar panels can reduce light intensity that the panel should fully receive. People mostly ignore it, so it may cause their solar panels to not work in full performance of them. From this problem, we have the idea that is to design a dirt monitoring system for solar panels, to detect the dirtiness on the panels and clean them if it is too dirty!

## Use cases
Dirt monitoring system is designed to support solar panels in households. The system can detect dirt on the panels by dirt sensor attached on the panels. Each solar panel has one monitoring node that includes dirt detection and other parameters (temperature under panel, light intensity, rain, voltage and current flow from the panel, and energy) for only itself.  The dirtiness will be converted into score and is sent with all other data to keep in a cloud memory via WiFi for monitoring in far distance. The users can monitor the dirtiness of their panels with the other parameters in a mobile app and command them back to clean their panels or automatically clean by themselves if the score reaches a specific limit.

## Objectives
+	To create dirt monitoring for solar panels
+	To create a wireless monitoring system and a mobile app for users to monitor any parameters detected on solar panels
+	To clean dirt on solar panels by users or itself in case of exceeding a specific limit

## Scope
+	1 monitoring node
+	Real-time monitoring (Back up historical data in future)
+	No electrical load, only solar panels with battery
+	Monitor dirtiness on each panel, temperature under panel, light intensity, rain, voltage and current flow from the panel, and energy generated from the panel

## List of features
+	Monitor the dirtiness of solar panels with other parameters (temperature under panel, light intensity, rain, voltage and current flow from the panel, and energy) in a mobile app.
+	Command cleaning solar panels via a mobile app or automatically clean by themselves if the dirtiness score reaches a specific limit.

## Learning Goals
+	To learn and apply ITO and Non-ITO film to create a dirt sensor
+	To learn basic ideas of how to create wireless communication system
+	To learn basic ideas of how to create a mobile app
